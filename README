This is a collaborative learning project organised by the GIST foundation's mobile development group ( http://thegisthub.net/groups/mobile-developer/ ). The aim is to produce a usable mobile radio player application for the Community Media Association, and along the way learn a little more about mobile development. Initially, we're trying to do everything in HTML5 and then use packaging tools like PhoneGap.
