This is a collaborative learning project organised by the GIST foundation's mobile development group ( http://thegisthub.net/groups/mobile-developer/ ). The aim is to produce a usable mobile radio player application for the Community Media Association, and along the way learn a little more about mobile development. Initially, we're trying to do everything in HTML5 and then use packaging tools like PhoneGap.

Android notes
-------------

The android app was first generated with the command
droidgap gen cmaplayer, and it can be found in the phoneapp,android folder


Build/Run cycle

Start the android emulator with 
emulator @test1
(Where test1 is the name of a device you have configured using the "android" utility)

Apparently, ant clean compile install should then install your app in the running VM, but I could never get that to work.

Instead, I just ran the ant and then manually did "adb install -r ./bin/cmaplayer-debug.apk"


Hint: If you need to access a service on localhost from the android emulator, use http://10.0.2.2:8080/app/url instead of localhost. Works a treat.


Signing... Used

/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/keytool -genkey -v -keystore gist.keystore -alias gist -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

To generate a self-signed key


Android app screenshots -

use ddms http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/ddms.html


Upgrading to a more recent / patched droidgap..

Build a sample test app, then copy the phonegap.n.n.n.jar and .js to the project, don't forget to modify the .js import in the index.html
